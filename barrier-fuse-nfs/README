To run the barrier-test perform the following :
1. Get the executable file by compiling barrier-test.c
  >> gcc -o barrier-test barrier-test.c

2. Run the script
  >> barrier-sanity.sh
  
  Note: This script doesn't enable barrier, but it prompts to 
        enable barrier, before running the test.
        You can skip the test by pressing "n", when it prompts to
        enable barrier
